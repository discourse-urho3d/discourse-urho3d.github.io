<p>Urho3D<br/>
18th August 2010 – 20th January 2023</p>
<hr/>
<p>FYI: There are <em>two</em> Urho3D-related Discord servers, which have some activity and are <em>not</em> shutting down. If you want a place to discuss something Urho3D-related, you can do it there. You can find up-to-date invites <a href="https://u3d.io/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a> or <a href="https://rebelfork.io/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I guess I can write some thoughts here too, what’s the worst that can happen? No need for ChatGPT, can do that myself.</p>
<p>I joined Urho just before this forum was launched. I saw it launching, with people, shiny new UI, achievement badges, and other stuff. Now I see it shutting down.</p>
<p>I have been working with Urho3D codebase for 6 years, first in the upstream and then in the fork. I am still using Urho3D codebase, and I don’t think I’ll stop any time soon. I just like it more than any other engine I touched, even if it’s far from perfect.</p>
<p>[CW: personal opinions below]</p>
<p><span class="mention">@1vanK</span> you are right that forum shutdown doesn’t make the engine dead. Urho3D was in decline long before that, forum shutdown is just formal event to draw a line.</p>
<p>I am genuinely sad to see it happening. Five years ago, there were a lot of people who contributed to the engine in different ways. I believed that there was enough of traction even after Lasse retired. Unfortunatelly, the lack of direction and the lack of proper leadership wasted this potential, and almost all these people moved on.</p>
<p>I abandoned Urho3D upstream when I saw the huge gap between “good working code” and “merged PR”, and that I didn’t have the energy to fill this gap anymore. <a href="https://discourse-urho3d.github.io/t/to-rbfx-and-not-to-rbfx/5864/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">When I proposed a direction for Urho3D to move</a>, there was too much squabble and too little support. These old threads are actually fun to re-read now, with the post-knowledge of the future.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I disagree with this statement.<br/>
Urho3D is dead <em>mainly</em> because it rejected contributions and contributiors.<br/>
If the project pushes away contributors, at some point it won’t have contributors anymore.</p>
<p>For example, Rokas added support of submodules, and simplified build system a lot. Sure, his build system doesn’t have <em>all</em> the features of the Urho3D build system. But… why does it matter? It is good enough, it works today with minimal tweaks on all platforms, it is much simpler, and in some aspects it is outright <em>better</em> than current Urho3D build system. There was a PR. It was rejected.</p>
<p>Another example. I wanted to contribute my work in Urho3D, three years ago. I proposed the changes that I made. I received a lot of distracting quarell, some insults, and very little support. I concluded that Urho3D <em>doesn’t want</em> my contributions either.</p>
<p>If some open-source project loses contributors, it’s because it’s either becoming irrelevant, or it has poor management/leadership, or both. There is no point in blaming the users, because the users are always the same in all open source projects.</p>

<p>Why start this thread again before the forum closes? Rbfx is a little more dead than Urho3D because you makes changes for the sake of changes. There is no niche for him to occupy. It’s trying to be more than just an indie game engine, but you can’t compete with engines that hundreds of people are developing.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to reject PR. A common practice is that a some person sends a poor quality PR and then does not make an effort to finish it. Guess who will have to maintain this piece of unfinished code?</p>

<p>If you are talking about stupid containers, then it is correct that they were not accepted. At the same time, there was a general vote and you were in the minority.

<p>Rbfx is a little more dead than Urho3D because you makes changes for the sake of changes. There is no niche for him to occupy.</p>

<p>Godot has a niche, and I believe there is a place there for rbfx. Only time will tell if I am right or wrong.</p>

<p>Guess who will have to maintain this piece of unfinished code?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>True. The problem with Urho3D was that <em>maintenance itself</em> became much more annoying than it should have been (manual bindings, crippled containers, lots of legacy and compatibility concerns).</p>

<p>Let’s deal with facts. Link to that PR and explain why it’s not shit. And also consider whether you have accepted such changes in rbfx.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>rbfx as a fork <em>started</em> with this PR, because it wasn’t merged in master.<br/>
rbfx lives today just fine with this new build system with minimal issues, therefore it was at least okay-ish PR.<br/>
Also, it doesn’t have this weird umaintainable <code>rakefile</code> in ruby <img alt=":laughing:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/laughing.png?v=12" title=":laughing:" width="20"/></p>

<p>Yep. I left because my point of view was’t as supported as I hoped to.<br/>

<p>ok you are right. I remembered that we were doing comparative tests of performance and east lost. In addition, you wrote that eastl containers have dreamed allocators that you don’t use in rbfx for some reason.</p>

<p>One mobile game two years ago (of which there are also many for Urho3D), screenshot (of which there are also many for Urho3D), promise a super cool games (of which there are also many for Urho3D).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are Urho3D games in Steam.</p>
<p>It’s especially funny that I don’t see the useless PBR in the screenshots that you’re promoting as an advantage to the engine. Hence the same game could be made on Urho3D.</p>
<p>You just forgot that rbfx is already an old engine, not a new fork. You can’t say that well, we’ve only just begun, but we’re progressing.</p>
