<p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>In this topic I want to discuss fork of Urho3D known as <strong>rbfx</strong> and possible feature merge from rbfx back into original Urho3D. This topic is <em>not</em> a proposal or announcement but the opening of discussion.<br/>
I really don’t believe rbfx and vanilla can be merged completely, but I’d like to bring them as close as possible.</p>
<p>In case you have no idea what I’m talking about, here is the link to rbfx:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/rokups/rbfx" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/rokups/rbfx</a></p>
<hr/>
<p>Initially rbfx was quite close to original Urho3D (I will call it vanilla from now on) in terms of codebase and feature set.</p>
<p>However, the divergence grows as time goes on.</p>
<p>And this divergence becomes really annoying for users of both projects.</p>
<p>I cannot make wide-scope changes in rbfx because it will make things even worse than they are now. I cannot merge my changes into vanilla because it would require tedious rework of codebase. Users of both projects cannot simply switch back and forth because API is already incompatible to a certain degree: it’s nearly impossible to write code working both on vanilla and rbfx.</p>
<p>Oh, I hate forks soo much. And I don’t want to repeat the story of Atomic.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>What does <strong>rbfx</strong> offer and why bother?</h4>
<p>There are several major and multiple minor features, including native Editor (WIP), <em>automatic</em> C# bindings, <a href="https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/ready-to-use-lightmapper-and-light-probe-baker/5844/1">built-in lightmapper that you all have probably seen</a>, universal user-friendly serialization from/to binary/XML/JSON instead of this terrible (and sometimes broken) x6 copy-paste in vanilla Urho, profiler, type-safe logging and string formatting using <code>fmt</code>, subdirectory support by build system and so on and so on.</p>
<p>I’m planning to do some major renderer changes too, but I won’t make any promises here.</p>
<h4>What’s the problem with “just merging” everything back into vanilla Urho?</h4>
<p>Short story: there are breaking changes. A lot. And a lot of dependencies between features too.</p>
<p>So it’s actually impossible to merge rbfx into vanilla “by bits”: it’s a package deal, and the package is huge.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The broadest (in terms or API affected) breaking change is using EASTL standard library instead of custom Urho containers. Yeah, Urho containers may have some nice features, but they are sorely lacking compared to EASTL or STL libraries. I personally switched to rbfx just because it’s so much easier to write code with standard containers. Maybe in the future it would even be possible to take the next step and switch to STL completely.</p>
<p>This change is mandatory to merge anything else from rbfx into vanilla Urho. It will also require certain rework in script bindings. Lua would probably be easy to fix because it has compile-time type checks. AS would be more painful. Speaking of which…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The biggest (in terms of functionality) breaking change in rbfx: AngelScript is gone. Forever.</p>
<p>You see, AS is <em>assembly</em> library. Just think about it. Urho is using <em>raw assembly</em> right now in 2020. Not just for optimization, but as scripting core. AS has <em>zero</em> compile-time type safety, so if you make a mistake or forget to update some <em>manually written</em> binding code, you will get real-time crash, or UB, or data corruption, or anything. Manual and fragile bindings to AS greatly decrease code maintainability.</p>
<p>Consequently, vanilla Urho Editor is gone. Yeah, writing Editor basing on AS scripting sample was a mistake. It’s sad because vanilla Editor is quite nice and has a lot of features. But it is really hard to extend due to poor architecture and using AS bindings instead of propper C++.</p>
<p><em>Theoretically</em>, it’s possible to merge stuff from rbfx and keep AS and vanilla Editor. However, I’m not going to do anything for it – neither to fix conflicts on merge nor support manual bindings, ever. Feel free to volunteer for this task.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>So, what do you think?<br/>
Is it worth a shot, or I want too much?<br/>
Is it better to try to bring rbfx and Urho closer or let them diverge forever, essentially becoming separate projects?<br/>
It’s not too late yet, but every major update in rbfx will make things more complicated than they are now.</p>

<p>Here are my 2 cents of this proposal.</p>
<p>It was actually one of my plans to get some parts of the rbfx back to the Urho. It has a lot of nice features that Urho lacks. It’s sad seeing AS go, but I guess it’s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of guys out there who don’t want to see the C# support in it, but I guess it’s fine as long as it’s a optional dependency and by default the engine is built without it. (note: I’m not too excited about it either)</p>

Most other effort stuck into rbfx could have been applied to Urho3D.</p>

<p>Hello, this is my first time using the forum although I have been using Urho3D for about 2 or 3 years now.</p>
<p>I would like to say that I think that this proposal is a very radical change.</p>
<p>Although I have seen rbfx mentioned before on the forum, I never took a close look at it until now.<br/>
And seeing C# and that WYSIWYG editor that looks like Unity sent shivers down my spine.</p>
<p>I fear that bringing C# to Urho3D will turn this into a nightmare, and, in time, will root itself permanently into the core of the engine.<br/>
Given how traumatic apparently merging the changes from rbfx to Urho3d will be, I am afraid that that will almost certainly be the case.</p>
<p>To be quite honest, I would like to see even AngelScript and Lua completely removed from the engine.<br/>
C/C++ is not that hard and it tends to force the developer to know what he is doing and to program properly and efficiently.</p>
<p>In my opinion, bringing C# and WYSIWYG to Urho3D is steering the ship on the very opposite direction of what Urho3D is now.</p>
<p>I only ask that if this goes forward, please, announce it early so those that don’t like this direction can have time to fork Urho3D or move to some other engine or library.</p>

<p>I don’t like AS because it has no IDE or real useful debugger which supports urho. I don’t see scripting is useful in a serious project without IDE support. I don’t like C# because it is heavy and pain to maintain? Though its IDE and stuff would be much better.</p>
<p>Urho’s container is good IMO, light weight as Urho itself. Not as powful, but easy to read and use. Just like Urho. Why we like Urho, because it is simple and nice. Otherwise I would just use UE4, Unity or Godot.</p>
<p>The worst thing about Urho is Editor and workflow. IMHO, rbfx is better in some aspects is because the brave author has been really working hard on it.</p>
<p>If Urho also has a IMGUI based editor, people would be much optimistic.</p>

<p>C# bit uses sort of a “hack” where main exe is .NET. This is so we can support multiple runtimes without writing code to host managed runtime. This is just a detail though. You can write most of your code in a <code>.dll</code>. Editor is a good example of large native application that gets loaded as a DLL. You do not even notice that it isnt a native exe.</p>
<p><code>CallCSharpFunction</code> bit is possible (terms and conditions apply!), but someone needs to write it.</p>

<p>This is quite funny to read about “bringing WYSIWYG to Urho3D” because vanilla Urho Editor <em>is</em> the stereotypical example of WYSIWYG editor.</p>

<p>Unusual point of view. I wouldn’t say Urho containers are easy to use. They have maybe 5% of EASTL functionality and I had to write several times more code with Urho containers.<br/>
And this is after all the time we (me including) spent on improving these containers.</p>

</aside>
<p>If we are talking about some feature, e.g. container library, it can be in 4 states.</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>It may be completely finished.</li>
<li>It may stagnate (this is what happening with Urho Containers now)</li>
<li>It may be supported (thats what we did with Urho Containers before, e.g. I added move semantics for Vector)</li>
<li>It may be delegated to 3rd party (like we did in rbfx)</li>
</ol>
<p>I personally cannot understand why choose to stagnate when there is available option of developement. This should be default way to go – to delegate support if there is reasonably lightweight open-source 3rdparty. We don’t have custom physics or custom image decoder. Why have custom containers?..</p>
<p>And Urho containers are not finished, they are missing a lot of features.<br/>
Small buffer optimization? Forget that. Allocators? Nah. Algorithms? Nope. Containers except vector and hash map? No, there is none. Move semantics? Barely. Spans and string views? Phew, nope, we will write copy-pasted <code>foo(const char*)</code> and <code>foo(const String&amp;)</code> instead.<br/>
I would have never finished my lightmapper if I had to deal with ever-lacking custom container library.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s your biased opinion. Urho is alive and well and widely used. Just because a fork has bells and whistles doesn’t mean the original is dying or becoming obsolete.</p>
<p>As for the EASTL vs. Urho, that’s a discussion that should be done separately. Outsourcing complex things is one of the things Urho does well (very good libraries being used for many different things). However, I disagree that EASTL is more active than Urho. Just look a their repo: no leadership, no support, no release schedule, nothing. Just a bunch of fixes here and there by users. How is that different from what Urho has today?</p>

</aside>
<p>If you need only 5% of container functionality, it’s your choise.<br/>
There are people who need more.<br/>
Why these people have to deal with underimplemented container library?<br/>
There’s thin line between “lightweight” and “lacking features”, and Urho Containers are more second than first.</p>

</aside>
<p>The difference is that EASTL has about 20 times more features than Urho Containers.<br/>
And these features are must have for me.<br/>
For example, strings and vectors that don’t allocate memory.</p>
<p>And yes, EASTL is also updated. Unlike Urho Containers. HashMap still doesn’t support move semantics.</p>

<p>I’m not a fan of containers, to me though urho’s container is simple to some extent, as long as it is usable, it is good. I used other opensource game engines  before I don’t see we are required to use powerful containers. Especially Urho is. C++ based game engine, KISS is an important characteristic among game engines out there. Additionally,  there is no critical features we really need from rbfx, though I love Eugene’s embree lightmaping solution. I integrated Beast (lightmap midware Unity usefit before Enlighten, was bought by Autodesk, and dead?)before, I know how important lightmap for most of 3d games.</p>

<p>IMHO, Python s*cks for an multiplatform game engine. There is no light weight and multiplatform VM, and it is very slow general ly.

I think that’s why Godot choose to implement a Python look and feel language in the first place.</p>

<p>In regards to the containers, there are a few things I like more about the Urho containers (like CamelCase on the function names, which I prefer, and a couple other things I don’t remember at the moment), but I would be in favor of switching to a more complete 3rd party solution, as long as we didn’t lose features from it. I’ve run into issues with Urho’s containers a couple times, and it would be nice to gain the extra features without having to reinvent the wheel and implement it myself. Beyond that, containers like the stl ones are the most likely to have already made solutions for script bindings, so implementing script bindings in the future could be easier that way (for those of us who do like having script bindings).</p>
<p>So I support switching to the new containers, though I don’t necessarily support all of the changes (like removing AngelScript).</p>

<p>Ue4 use its own containers, if we want them more powerful, heros can improve them. Personally, I prefer keep using current containers or embrace the future and radical change by using cpp std. I used to stay in a team where people wrap STLPort and make their own containers. I guess they want safer interfaces and an unified look &amp; feel with other parts of the engine, or they might find stl is faster, such as memory and cache optimizations.</p>

<p>I don’t think we need separate thread, because this topic highly corellates with subject.</p>
<p>If we want to stick with Urho containers, then we cannot merge code from rbfx to Urho.</p>
<p>If we want to move to std-like containers, the most reasonable thing is to pick already ported code from rbfx. We don’t even need to pick anything else from rbfx: container migration alone will close 90% of the API gap between rbfx and Urho.</p>

<p>I see only one issue with <code>std</code>. Somebody will need to do huge and tedious work of migration of whole Urho codebase at once. Some parts of code will have to be heavily rewritten, like Variant.<br/>
But migration to EASTL is <em>already done</em>.<br/>
Moreover, once you migrated to EASTL, you can migrate to <code>std</code> incrementally, file by file and place by place.</p>

<p>If rbfx already has EASTL, and C# and the WYSIWYG are already implemented there, why not just move there and continue development there?</p>

</aside>
<p>Are you basically suggesting us to do exactly what we are already doing for last 1…3 years?..<br/>
I and some other people “moved there” long time ago and “continued developement there” too.</p>
<p>And guess what? Not everyone is happy that Urho misses some useful contributions that rbfx receives.<br/>
You ever considered opinion of people who <em>both</em> want changes and to stay with vanilla Urho?</p>
<p>You are arguing with me as if I’m the one who needs these changes.<br/>
<em>I don’t</em> need <em>this merge and I’m not enthusiastic about it because I have already moved to rbfx</em>.<br/>
I just think it would be the most optimal way to utilize resources and I like being optimal.</p>

</aside>
<p><em>Stability</em> is not necessarily bad. I’d say, it’s good!<br/>
Stability is when there are no changes because you have enough and you don’t need more.<br/>
Stagnation <em>is bad</em>.<br/>
Stagnation is when changes are needed but they are hindered by obstacles, like container library written for 20 years old technologies or manual fragile bindings with zero compile time checks.</p>
<p>Whether the Urho is stable or stagnating… I’m not sure. I think, in between. It has a lot. It misses a lot.</p>

<p>This question is meaningless. People who are “not happy with Urho” moved <em>already</em>.</p>
<p>What about people who <em>both</em> want changes and to stay with vanilla Urho?<br/>
This is the most voted option in the poll, if you didn’t notice. People who want changes <em>and</em> want to stay. I was one of such people for a long time. Maybe I still am – I’ll return to vanilla Urho on first opportunity (when it gets <em>real</em> container library and native editor. And no manual bindings because they suck so much).</p>

<p>Seems to me like this overhaul would introduce a lot of work that would cause existing issues and PRs to get snowed in. If you want to work on Urho3D, do so, but let Urho be Urho and may rbfx fill a niche of its own. If you regret working on the wrong engine, rest assured in the fact that you gained experience while doing so.</p>

<p>Sure, because 10 votes (and 4 of them already use brfx and I have no idea what are doing here) represent the totality of users of the engine. Maybe checking how many clones or downloads the repository have would be a lot better indicator of the real userbase.</p>

<p>Either I’m writing too cryptic or you are outright ignoring what I’m saying.<br/>

<p>You say you want changes, but when you are offered functional improvements with relatively small price… You don’t want it anymore, because you will /gasp/ have to spend an hour to migrate your code to the new version.<br/>
What do you suggest then? What should be done instead? There are people who want to work with Urho and who need better container library. What do you suggest to do for these people?</p>

<p>Those breaking changes sound significant.  In changing the containers, my existing programs are going to have to change, is this a drop in replacement or will logic have to change too.  I guess I won’t have to worry about moving my Angelscript programs forward. I could use C# though?  As the rbfx wiki page says “<img alt=":warning:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/warning.png?v=9" title=":warning:"/> C# support is experimental <img alt=":warning:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/warning.png?v=9" title=":warning:"/> It may not work correctly, fail or crash in spectacular ways. Managed APIs will likely change in the future.”.<br/>
To me, it sounds like some of these changes could be moved into Urho thru the Issue/Pull Request route and that way, it could be peer review and argued about.<br/>
Dropping AS, Lua is interesting. For me, this would be the end of Urho and the start of rbfx, and anyone that had existing programs, they are done, choiceless.</p>

<p>Having recently switched to RBFX (~2 weeks ago) and been plugging away figuring out the differences and migrating my things over … everything I thought I was against in it really is just “<em>who even cares, it works</em>” once I sat down with the repo and a lot of it (EASTL in particular) eased a lot of project ping-pong friction making it much more pleasant.</p>
<p>Some hiccups here and there, but in general I quite enjoy the move and don’t see myself having any trouble getting most of my engine changes moved over - I’m looking forward to making PRs for some of those and porting a couple of the examples over to C# (working on 39_CrowdNavigation r/n).</p>
<p>All-in-all, RBFX is solid and a pleasant change.</p>

<p>. Please, do not take this the wrong way, but, in corporate terms, this almost looks like a “hostile takeover”.</p>

<p>That’s doesn’t resemble anything. If anything this thread was opened with the vibe of being about things in RBFX reaching a cusp where if it continues on there will be nearly zero hope of porting them backwards to Urho3D and there will be no one remaining willing to bother with that work - which will only get worse and worse.</p>

<p>STL containers sure would make the CMake scripts <em>fun</em>. Joy for adding more build targets to deal with STL switches. Mismatched STL configurations between libraries is tons of fun. /s</p>

<p>Neither of them captured contributors like RBFX has though. The commit logs alone show that almost all active talent has moved to RBFX. Urho3D is left with <span class="mention">@SirNate0</span> <span class="mention">@1vanK</span> and <span class="mention">@weitjong</span> as active contributors of note.</p>
<p>The commit history sealed the deal for me to make the move, I recognized every contributor and knew roughly who they were and what they’ve done which gave me a lot of confidence moving to RBFX.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The ideal situation is that Urho3D grabs what it can right now while it still can from RBFX and RBFX then moves forward more heavy-handed than Urho3D willing to lock into things like “<em>we shall use Metal-ness</em>” (or spec, w/e, just lock into something so we can sit down and do PBR right).</p>

<p>I am quite disappointed in the discussion. Nobody is talking about technical aspects of changes. Most vocal voices focus on what they want personally. There is absolutely no regard for what other people might find useful. If you do not need it - does not mean everyone else does not. If you do not like some feature - you do not have to use it (except for containers). And worst of all - nobody advocating for no change said “i will step up and maintain containers/bindings/etc”. And most confusingly poll indicates exact opposite of general vibe in this thread.</p>
<p>So please <span class="mention">@adhoc99</span> point out some technical problems with proposed approaches. Point out how your <em>important</em> projects will get hurt. Do you have a commercial product that depends on maintenance of current codebase? This is important information.</p>

<p>A bit of clarity.<br/>
AngelScript not using asm in binding process - it just some aripmetical tricks with provided function pointers, and it transparent for programmer. All the programmer needs to do is write the string with the AngelScript’s method description correctly. The AngelScript uses assembler to package arguments when making an native call, and this also remains behind the scenes for the platforms it supports. C# does exactly the same thing, because it is not magic that it call to native functions.<br/>
The only difference in the details is that the bindings from C++ to the AngelScript are created manually, and to C# it done automatically using SWIG. And if SWIG is mistaken somewhere and forms the wrong binding, everything will fail the same way. If anybody teach SWIG to create bindings for a AngelScript, there will be no difference with C#.</p>
<p>AngelScript also potentially has a JIT - it can be embedded in the library and this will significantly increase its execution speed.<br/>
The AngelScript is much smaller than the C# and does not require dragging along a bunch of dependencies in the form of a .NET framework or Mono. Meanwhile, its capabilities are enough to implements the game logic. The only drawback is that there are no native calls for ARM64 yet, which somewhat slows down work on modern Android and IOS systems. And, of course, there are far fewer people who know the AngelScript than they know C# <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>
<p>I forgot one more minus of the script - there is no ready-made debugger in the library, although can add it, there are such solutions.</p>

<p>You have to either do like lua and fat glue or do like Angelscript and thunk to make foreign calls. These are your options.</p>
<p>CoreRT uses thunking for all PInvoke calls just like angelscript … so any argument against Angelscript for using ASM is outright dead because you have to call CoreRT everything you would call Angelscript for doing such.</p>

</aside>
<p>When you make AS bindings you lose all C++ type information about function.<br/>
Therefore the binding string directly controls the assembly that is going to perform the native call.<br/>
So when you are making a binding, you are touching asm thru very thin API layer.<br/>
Or am I wrong here?</p>
<p>The difference here is that SWIG is automatic and end user does not need to touch asm when they are writing their code. Once configured, it just works ™ most of the time and if user made a mistake, they will get compilation or preprocessing error.</p>
<p>AS have asm exposed, so if <em>end user</em> touches it in wrong way, the application explodes.</p>

<p>I’ll leave my thoughts on scripting, based on my own Urho3D usage. I may not be right but here it goes…<br/>
AngelScript is awesome, but I don’t think its attracting people. The effort and skills required to use AS is close to (as not the same as) those required to just use C++, so why not just use C++… My Urho3D based (media player like) application requires some scripting but other devs I’m working with just don’t have the skill to code on AS and enough time to learn it. They prefer having a Lua, JS or Python scripting system with running examples that they can extend and easy to find samples on the net.</p>

<p>Definitely agreed. But that is not happening for AS. It isnt even happening for lua even though lua is easier of two. But we should not forget lack of ecosystem around AS. It is said already that you basically have your notepad and thats it. lua at least has a richer ecosystem around it, editor plugins that support debugging even… Of course nothing beats C# in editor support. Not trying to say that Urho needs C#, just pointing out that good tools make life a lot easier. That should be of some consideration at least.</p>

<p>I am not unreasonable. Start working on it. No matter how long it will take. It is a lot of boring work nobody wants to do though… Same stands for lua by the way. It is only marginally better than AS. We have some plans to bind lua using SWIG in the future.</p>

<p>From a perspective of someone who is more interested in using the engine instead of making one, dropping AS would be a big mistake. Thanks to AS it’s possible to create application, that can be easily modified by the end-user. I think that we all need to agree that when it comes to games modding support is very desired feature that helps to build a community around the title and can keep even old game alive for a long time. Also when it comes to other types of applications (not games), users usally prefer to have an ability to write some simple scripts that will automate their workflow. Now I know there’s still Lua, but rbfx dropped it also and the reasons behind this move are still valid, so there’s a big chance that Lua would simply be next in line to be removed (apparently with plans to bring in back in some undefined future). In the end this will mean that changes that are supposed to make a live of a developer easier, would also limit what this developer can offer to the end user or would require additional work to bring back functionality that’s already there.<br/>
Next thing - as someone already pointed out C# support is experimental, rbfx site also states that editor is still WIP, so it seems like proposed changes mean that some parts of the engine would be improved, but there will also be a regression in other parts. I have not used rbfx so I don’t know what’s the current state of the editor (and that’s rather important tool), but if it’s far behind the ‘vanilla version’, it will also require some additional ‘manpower’ to bring at least current functionality and since rbfx is a thing for some time now, but editor there is still WIP, my guess is that’s it’s not very high on priority list there.</p>
<p>Finally, I must ask what’s next? Would this be a one-time ‘code synchronization’ or from now on both versions would be kept in synch (what’s the point of having two versions then?). If it’s supposed to be one time thing, than I don’t need to be a prophet to see what will happen later: rbfx users will stay with rbfx, urho users with stay with urho or even will stick to version before changes (because of the compatibility breakadge), rbfx and urho will go their own ways, after some time once again there will be too many differences, to make a project compatible (or easy to port) with both versions and we will be back in the same discussion just about different features - so I would like to know what’s the plan there?</p>

<p>If the community is convinced, as long as EASTL itself alone does not break things too much, we may provide some scripts/way to help people migrate their own projects.</p>
<p>As for AngelScript, can we make things automatic? like SWIG for C#? So we just keep lua, AngelScript and scripts based Editor, as long as we don’t have a better alternative yet so discarding any of the parts are not considerable. If people love C#, use it.</p>
<p>So, everyone is happy and Urho is stronger. Am I asking too much (based on the community size and contributor number)?</p>

Merge is ****ing hard work! That I will be doing in my <em>personal unpaid time</em>.</p>

<p>And obviously, every single contribution that I may or may not make, for every single feature or breaking change, will have to be discussed on the forum and reviewed as PR by the community on GitHub.</p>
<p>And here you are, accusing me of pushing rbfx over Urho as if I have just force-pushed Urho3D master branch.</p>
<p>Such attitude towards a person who is basically <em>offering a gift</em> is deeply insulting.</p>

<p>There are several major and multiple minor features, including native Editor (WIP), <em>automatic</em> C# bindings, <a href="https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/ready-to-use-lightmapper-and-light-probe-baker/5844/1">built-in lightmapper that you all have probably seen</a>, universal user-friendly serialization from/to binary/XML/JSON instead of this terrible (and sometimes broken) x6 copy-paste in vanilla Urho, profiler, type-safe logging and string formatting using <code>fmt</code> , subdirectory support by build system and so on and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IMHO,</p>
<ul>
<li>universal user-friendly serialization is optional, it’s just more convenient. Can we also make one in vanilla?</li>
<li>profiler can also introduced to Urho, as another outsourced feature of Urho, by using <em>Tracy</em> as rbfx</li>
<li>logging is just optional, the vanilla one works good, I don’t see many people complain  about the current one.</li>
<li>string formatting using <code>fmt</code>is also optional, I don’t see many people complain about the current one.</li>
<li>C# controversial, skip it currently.</li>
<li>Without more from the list, I don’t know more about rbfx.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Editor</strong><br/>
I checked the Editor. If I can understand deep enough, IMHO, it is still not very usable, not as featured as AS based one in Urho at least, though the latter has many issues and not pleasant to use to me. The rbfx author has been trying to make the workflow run, asset import/export… but not there yet. A lot of detailed stuff are not done yet, but I can understand to some extent the willing behind the code and the GUI. Maybe Editor is something people like Eugene really want from rbfx? But it’s far from done.</p>
<p><strong>Lightmap Baker</strong><br/>
I know the lightmapping implementation is nice and Eugene has done it beautifully, but it is based on the rbfx code, without the editor and eastl, lightmapping lost its foundation. Or maybe <strong>re-design it as a stand alone project, which allows baking by input of scene information</strong>?</p>
<p>I’m for the stl introduction if it really releases productivity, and happy to see more features into Urho, but I against breaking Urho for introduction of the editor from rbfx, or the Lightmap Baker, if I have a vote.</p>

<p>I believe so. Proper container library simplifies making changes in the engine and enables more optimizations. I don’t mean that it will make existing code faster (however this may happen too), but you can <em>write</em> faster code with better container library.</p>

<p>I’m glad the EASTL discussion has been broken out into a separate thread, because there’s more heat than light in the present discussion.</p>
<p>Pretty sure I know where the animosity is coming from though.  De-blessing of scripting languages is an <strong>existential threat</strong> to communities.  The track record from my previous experience in the Ogre3D ecology is clear.  When a scripting language does not receive fully blessed support from its engine, it <em>dies</em>.  The one person cobbling the binding together in their spare time, eventually loses interest and moves on to other things.  <em>Any</em> work that was done on top of that scripting language, the kind of work that is immediately visible to actual users, rapidly dies with it.  If you want a healthy ecology to exist around an engine, <em>you have to decide what your scripting languages are</em>.</p>
<p>Just because someone doesn’t like the risks of typeless or hand crafted languages, isn’t a reason to take them seriously.  I don’t know of any engineering solution that doesn’t give you bugs.  It’s all a matter of what provides a benefit <em>in the real world</em> and what doesn’t.  What is supported, maintained, and improved and what isn’t.</p>
<p>I don’t have a handle on how much AngelScript ecology surrounds Urho3D, but if people rationally decide it’s substantial, then abandoning it is not to be taken lightly.  Frankly in that case I’d call it a dealbreaker.  And why should it matter to rbfx back porting efforts anyways?  They don’t have any AngelScript stuff to backport.  If rbfx devs want to become main Urho3D devs, well then they can just do it with the caveat that they won’t bother with AS, no way no how.  That’s a political problem not a technical one.</p>
<p>I’m not in favor of C# bandwagons because I don’t like the language, and I don’t see what a 3D engine going ala C# is offering anybody over Unity.  Maybe someone can explain to me why they really really want C#, and not Unity and its ecology.  The vast majority of game devs who don’t put much effort into this stuff, are just going for Unity and being “happy” with the money they’re making / saving.  Explain to me why they need rbfx instead.</p>
<p>Lua, on the other hand, is a proper scripting language, and fast for being one.  It of course has tradeoffs.  It also has a lot of proven use in the game industry.  It’s not crazy talk to build a 3D engine ecology around Lua.  I definitely see the case use for Lua instead of C#.</p>
<p>I can’t take the “do it only in C++” crowd seriously.</p>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of years trying to invent my own programming language, that would be a unified C++ and scripting language replacement.  Nothing to report so far.  I’ve got maybe 2 ideas, in all that time, that are actually <em>good</em> and should be implemented.  I may yet make an attempt now.  I’m currently contemplating the problem of making 3d art assets by hand typing into text files, as opposed to 3d editors.  Maybe that will finally get me going.</p>
<p>Jonathan Blow has his Jai langauge in the hands of a few beta testers now.  Maybe he’s finally going to release it onto the world?</p>
<p>I have followed <em>many</em> languages over the years, trying to overcome the “C++ and scripting language” barrier to development.  Never did find a magic bullet.  But it has caused me to study a lot of language ecologies.  You can judge communities by what they <em>actually get done</em> with their languages.</p>

<p>If people use some other game engines, there are also many things not perfect. e.g. UE4 is complicated as hell, quality of life will be harder if you don’t use Blueprint, cocos2d-x lacks of a lot of features by your standard. But I’m still think if we can have these in Urho style, and without breaking Urho.</p>

<p>I’m in support of what ever you guys do.  But please if you can retain the function calls to be the same? So previous code will work.    Any new feature just introduce new calls.</p>

<p>Almost every open source project has a leader who does 90% of the work and determines the general course. Take a look at the Bullet and Box2D projects. These are VERY well-known projects and commonly used libraries. Its have a huge community. What happens when Erin Catto or Erwin Coumans leave? Even these projects will die. Unfortunately, such a fate befell our project. With all due respect to all project contributors I believe that the Urho3D project is what it is thanks to the Lasse’s vision. And we do not have a person whose opinion is unquestionably respected. On the other hand, I see that Rokups is a very enthusiastic person and has been developing his project for a long time. He has his own vision of how the project should be. Sooner or later, people who agree with his philosophy will gather around him. I believe that you should not try to merge two projects at any cost, throwing away what is a familiar part of Urho3D. Save for people the things that drew them to Urho3D.</p>

<p>I suggest what I wrote. People came to Urho3D because they liked it. You want to throw away things that attracted people to Urho3D. You want to take another project, with a different ideology and impose it on everyone who is not interested. Many people move to rbfx, the rest did not. Why are you depriving people of choice? I offer a evolutionary development of Urho3D without revolution. Repair what is broken and do not throw away what works.</p>

<p>Don’t make me repeat earlier discussion in this topic, please.</p>
<p><em>Features</em> don’t have ideology. They only have benefits and costs.<br/>
It matters not where do these features come from.</p>
<p>And if you are speaking about feature cut…<br/>
Well, I don’t know. I can see why people are being conservative and don’t want to lose anything.<br/>
But if certain features hinder development as a whole, shall they be kept?</p>
<p>In perfect world it is master actively developed, and release branch stagnates and is getting only bug fixes. When master stagnates because of features… this is weird path to develop a project.</p>

<p>My message indeed was phrased bad.<br/>
The best case scenario we get good things in Urho from or not from rbfx and keep them relatively close.<br/>
The good scenario is completely unchanging Urho and developing rbfx — in this case we may not care about painful merges from Urho (no changes, no merging)<br/>
The bad scenario is Urho getting minor and average features that rbfx will have to painfully merge.<br/>
The worst scenario is Urho and rbfx both actively developed and completely diverged.</p>

<p>Again, I disagree. To me this seems like one of the best possible scenarios. Each engine filling its niche and progressing. It would have been nice if <strong>rbfx</strong> were indeed developed as an experimental branch of Urho. Sadly the implications of this voiced purpose seem to have received little to no thought along the way, and now the incompatibility has grown to be cumbersome. Which is alright; rbfx went its own way and has gained value to exist in its own right. And so another great engine was born, but it is not for me.</p>

<p>Now, after reading so many replies, I think I quit talking and feel happy with Urho’s containers and other small parts. The whole engine is very unified internally and externally. In practical dirty commercial developing world, people care more about what can an engine provide, if they don’t like some part of the engine, they just stop using it in their own part of code. I’m writing code based on Urho in my very limited spare time and feel good about it.</p>
<p>Urho is designed to be lightweight, so keep it lightweight. It is beginner friendly. There are lots of game engines there, people can pick one of them or just choose rbfx. If someone really wants to improve it, take a part which is more like to be an obstacle. e.g. the rendering code. There are messy in the implementation, and not very feature powerful if you compare to other game engine.</p>
<p>There are more important things to fix, preventing Urho from a game maker! I’m talking about tasks like  releasing games on Steam, iOS, Android, even consoles. Let me give you an example. Cocos2d-x. It is a lightweight game engine but people fixed it to be a ready to use game engine and build tools around it. Guess what, many excellent mobile titles are made by it and people get whatever they want.</p>

Urho renderer is very rigid, but if you just add more flexibility in the joints it may start losing performance.<br/>

<p>People here are not ready to accept EASTL even if change of containers is purely cosmetic for end user. I mean, end user will not lose any features, they will just need to patch their names.</p>
<p>How can they accept actual feature cut in renderer?<br/>
And I have no idea how to improve renderer without cutting bits that are 15 years old and harm more than help. For example, zones. Discrete zones cannot support smooth transitions, therefore they are useless for making nice looking picture. And I’m not talking about aaa pbr whatever, it affects all 3D with non-trivial lighting.</p>

<p>Oh, I know this one. I tried to refactor editor twice, you know?<br/>
Sure, you can get simple linear transition between two colors within the box.<br/>
It will help you render perfectly smooth gradient corridor between uniformly light room and uniformly dark room.<br/>
How can it help in real scenes, not ones synthetically build for this feature?<br/>
And keep in mind that transition should be quite long, or you will get light popping when object is transferred from or to gradient zone.</p>

<p>Can anyone plz tell why the fork happend in the first place?<br/>
Was it (how <span class="mention">@johnnycable</span>  said) because urho main-devs are too restrictive?<br/>
What was the problem exactly? I can’t imagine they would have ignored ‘new feature’ pull-requests<br/>
if it was implemented the urho-way (I’m no power user and actually don’t know how difficult it is, to get a pull-request accepted, but I guess they had ‘stablity before features’ in mind (I’m guessing))</p>
<p>So the question is, are the problems that lead to the fork still valid? I guess yes, right?<br/>
If rbfx-people would ‘diverge back’ into urho again wouldn’t that just lead to the next conflict in no time?<br/>
I personally hate conflicts that don’t need to be. The decission to fork was as right back then as it is now.<br/>
You can go your own way with a great codebase and go in your own speed with your own restrictions. Would coming back  make anyone happier?</p>
<p>And I guess noone is really against breaking changes in Urho, if they come from within. But it is like this:<br/>
A 3rd party wants and demands changes to come back. I personally really don’t care about if we use Urho3d’s Containersystem or EASTL, but it is this situation that make me suspicious. “We come, we want and we will obviously keep wanting other things afterwards…”<br/>
I say keep the trouble out of the house even if it costs you some features or faster progress…</p>

<p>Of course, you can make an extra-heavy engine, but who will use it? Who will ceate an AAA project with a multi-million budget on this engine? Who will risk big money and rely on a project that supports a small community? Urho3D is unique in that it is the best engine in its niche. Why do we need PBR rendering and raytracing in a game where the model consists of 14 polygons?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This. Why do we need PBR rendering when 90% of indie games don’t have the budget to support an art team capable of producing assets that actually make good use of PBR? Why do we need Vulkan or a “better” renderer? It looks like yak shaving to me. Programming for the sake of programming and having the best state of the art codebase.</p>
<p>Urho is awesome because it is useful. It has the tools to help us make games. I can spin up a beautiful PBR “engine” in a month. But it won’t have usable animation, terrain, particles, audio, physics, scripting, IK, UI and all of the other hard stuff that Urho provides and that I actually need to create something. And Urho does it perfectly because it doesn’t get in my way. It’s like a framework, not an engine.</p>

<p>Yes, it will definitely attact more devs, but I guess more (a lot more) bad than good ones. Once there are a lot of them then someone could say “C# is so popular, we should focus all development on that and also add a Unity-like Editor because all these C# devs want that!”. Can you see my concern with this slippery slope, escalation and permanent change of direction?</p>

<p>Ok, I really think rbfx has its merits and a very clear direction. That is great for them.</p>
<p>Maybe all it needs is a bit of promotion so more people know about it.</p>
<p>These are honest suggestions to help rbfx be more popular (in no particular order):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Release a cool demo or game using it.<br/>
Nothing showcases an engine better than a demo.<br/>
I remember seeing NinjaSnowWar and thinking “ok, this engine can do it”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an Youtube channel and make videos about it.<br/>
Maybe some basic usage of the Editor so people that are used to other Engines can get on it quickly.<br/>
Also some demos of what rbfx can do, like the lightmapper mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make samples in C#.<br/>
Those help a lot newcomers since C# seens to be the focus of rbfx.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post about it on Reddit.<br/>
If people like it, it will spread fast.<br/>
If people do not, at least you will get some important feedback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an index at <a href="http://rbfx.github.io" rel="nofollow noopener">rbfx.github.io</a>.<br/>
So people can find news, updates, samples and the documentation there.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Valve worked a lot on QuakeEngine and GoldSrc became its own thing and that worked out great for them.<br/>
I really think rbfx should do the same.</p>

I don’t like C# as the only script option because it’s not truly part of the engine but chimeric augmentation on top of it.<br/>

Why it does not deserve this title?<br/>
It is a fork of Urho, technically. Philosophical questions aside.<br/>
It shares the core with Urho, even if said core is slightly changed.<br/>
And it is definitely experimental.<br/>

<p>I’m trying to change that and part of my work have been already “released” in rbfx.</p>

<p>I believe the focus of Urho should be lightweight performance, meaning relatively little to clone and build plus running fast on ageing hardware and fit for more than just games. Pretty modern day graphics are great to have as a capability, but the mere capability itself should not slow down simpler setups or  unnecessarily introduce fat libraries.</p>

<p>As I said before, sometimes the line between “lightweight” and “missing features” is very thin.<br/>
In my optinion, “lightweight” means that it is small and it can be extended on demand shall the need arise. While “missing features” means that is is small, but it also cannot be extended in case of need, at least not without significant effort. You see, size may be the same, but the scope of use cases is wastly different.</p>

<p>And exactly because so much is optional - but not part of core - I think Urho could benefit greatly from an extension exchange environment.

<p>I find it very odd how people are against increasing the visual fidelity of lighting in Urho. As time goes by, certain baseline expectations come into being. Things like PBR aren’t just passing fads that can be safely ignored because they’re ‘too hard’ to use, they’re increasingly taking over the discussion around lighting and asset creation. Without even attempting to meet those minimum expectations, Urho3D becomes a crusty old relic that the majority will pass over <em>by default</em> because it simply doesn’t meet their minimum expectations. I have decreased my own efforts of promotion for Urho3D in the various communities I inhabit, simply because more and more the devs I know want the support of a strong PBR pipeline. That alone should be at least a minimum capability of any engine that purports to be relevant today.</p>
<p>At this point, I can’t see 1.8 ever being finished, much less any Urho3D 2.0 project seeing completion. There are a lot of half-baked ideas for asset browsers and community building, but they’re empty shells with few prospects of turning into anything relevant or useful if development progress on the engine itself remains stagnant. Dead engine is dead. At least if these changes that the rbfx devs have introduced are merged upstream, there is a <em>chance</em> that some of the things being done in rbfx can be ported over as well. But the further from base rbfx gets, the harder that becomes.</p>
<p>The core devs are gone. <span class="mention">@cadaver</span> isn’t coming back, <span class="mention">@weitjong</span> has some pretty serious problems to deal with currently, and has already indicated in the past an inclination to step away from the project. On number of commits done, <span class="mention">@Eugene</span> has been among the largest contributor to vanilla, but apparently some individuals would rather he not make any more contributions. So who’s left that is actually doing things? Anyone? I see a lot of half-completed PRs, unsolved issues, empty recent commit history, and a whole lot of agitating for status quo. These aren’t signs of a healthy project, in my mind.</p>
<p>Even though I tinker with rbfx, I still have projects based in vanilla. My current active project is vanilla, and my terrain editor is still vanilla, though I do have a local rbfx-based branch that appears likely to become the master. Goblinson Crusoe is still vanilla-based. I don’t want to see vanilla remain dead. I’d rather have to spend a few days refactoring to meet the changes from rbfx, than see the engine fall further and further into irrelevancy like so many of my past favorites have done.</p>

<p>Yes, I use Lua. But you know what? Scripting language support already is pretty broken. A) It makes it difficult to merge PRs. Someone tries to do a new thing, but if they don’t also do script bindings for it, it doesn’t get merged. B) Lua scripting is broken. tolua++ has issues that have brought up years ago (ie <a href="https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/649" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/649</a> ) for how Urho objects returned by value from bound functions can greatly grow the size of internal tables if not carefully managed. tolua++ itself is an obsolete and unsupported project, that isn’t even keeping up with the language standard. So it’ll be a hard sell for you to convince me we should maintain the status quo, when the status quo is already a somewhat broken mess. Automated binding generation would go a LONG way toward solving some of these issues, which is part of what the rbfx devs were hoping to accomplish.</p>

<p>Yes. AS still has the issue of if you don’t write bindings for it, it doesn’t get merged. If it does get merged, AS becomes obsolete. Someone still has to maintain those script bindings if they’re not automatically generated, but that maintenance has to occur whether or not changes are merged from rbfx. Again, automatic script binding generation would go a LONG way toward solving some issues, and that was a stated objective of the rbfx devs.</p>

<p>Sadly, due to time constrains, I cannot contribute to urho or rbfx.<br/>
But as a user of urho, I can tell you what would make rbfx or a different fork attractive to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unified shaders</li>
<li>Metal support (maybe Vulkan too)</li>
<li>Compute shaders</li>
<li>General renderpath definition</li>
<li>Better asset pipeline (maybe)</li>
</ul>
<p>Different script binding, PBR, different containers, are very nice to have, but they are not limiting factors. One can implement any of them if they need to.<br/>
I don’t think making urho more like Unity (C#, nice editor)  will make it more attractive. Unity and Godot offer that already.<br/>
If a urho fork can offer at least some of this, it will make the switch very attractive.</p>
<p>To urho developers:<br/>
Don’t get me wrong, I love this engine, but maintaining two (maybe three if metal gets added) versions of my shaders is a big issue for me. Lacking compute shaders, metal support and full renderpath control limits what I can do with the engine. Current asset pipeline it’s not a deal breaker, but has many limitations.</p>

<p>Nobody is “making urho like unity”. If i wanted unity, i would use unity. I want ease of use of unity with flexibility of urho3d. Which means that you can use it however you want. There is no need to talk as if placing objects in the scene using a gizmo is some kind of sin. C# is great as a scripting language. It has a rich ecosystem around it, terrific tools. Heck you can debug C# plugins right from visual studio. That also is not a sin.</p>

<p>And you know, everyone acts as if we are here to take away your legacy v1. Branch we merely extended our hand and offered our free time to help make v2 happen while v1 can remain in maintenance mode as it has been for a good while to be honest. Something like ogre2. So this is a chance at having Urho3D v2.0. What will happen now is either community takes it and has a fighting chance or declines it and Urho3D forever remains as it is today. Some people are already migrating. The better rbfx gets - the worse Urho3D will look in comparison. Gap will widen more and more. There will be a point when editor is no longer heavily WIP and actually usable. Then we will promote it a little, just to put it next to Urho3D in google search. And when people do a comparison it will be nobrainer which project they should chose. rbfx commit history is a proof we can do it, and this friendly discussion encourages my evil genius to work hard towards that end.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually we have different ideas about scripting languages. You must compile a C# source as a Dll and connect it to a project in one of the ways as a plugin. This is not how the scripting language works. Or you can compile on the fly using the built-in compiler, load the compiled code, which in turn will load the rest of the engine libraries in a separate context, try to somehow take data from this context and transfer it to the main engine. This is in order to execute a single command in the console.</p>

<p>Could you clarify what you mean here? In rbfx everything is loaded in same <code>AppDomain</code> so data sharing is trivial. Also if you are interacting with scripting - all the .NET stuff is loaded already (that is how i made it anyway). Hot-reload is implemented using good old data serialization. I did explore using different <code>AppDomains</code> for scripting and that proved to be a nightmare for data sharing. Not that it was impossible, but it is a can of worms. Having everything in same <code>AppDomain</code> is just so much simpler and easier. Yes, we still have a problem where each code reload pollutes process memory with unused .NET libraries that are not unloaded. However .NET core 3+ has API for unloading them. We will eventually make use of that. There are many rough edges that need polishing, i do not deny it. But i do honestly believe C# as it is now in rbfx is almost as good as current bindings and even better in some other areas.</p>

<p>I guess you mean the fact that building with C# makes main executable a .NET exe? I agree with you there. It is just a shortcut to support multiple .NET runtimes without writing runtime-specific code. No reason we can not have a native executable host .NET runtime. People often dislike .NET runtime due to it’s size. It is way more fat than lua, there is no denying. But we are not distributing anything on floppy disks nowdays so size is hardly relevant. I totally understand personal preferences, choosing lua over C#. That is fine. Maybe eventually we can offer automated bindings for lua as well <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>I am not a developer Urho, although I am not indifferent.<br/>
There is a suggestion for the community.</p>
<p>Since there is no leader as such (but everyone has their own contribution to the engine), I propose voting like this (change the calculation as you wish) depending on the place <a href="https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/graphs/contributors" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/graphs/contributors</a> points are calculated for the voter, for example Kadavr has 1 place = 100 (total number of participants) -1 (place) = 99, weitjong 98 (100-2), etc. according to the results of voting, for example, be EAstl: yes or no, the sum of the votes of the voters is compared.<br/>
It does not matter if the current account or not - the order remains. If not in the list of developers, you can earn 1 point.</p>
<p>Any voting, at the same time you need to keep at least 3 (N?) Days on the forum, voting begins (you never know who will change their mind from someone’s reasoned arguments and change their mind)</p>
<p>Disputes take a lot of time and effort, sometimes you need cold-bloodedness</p>
<p>Raw plan, I propose to vote)</p>

<p>It’s not about the size of the files. C# free memory when RAM ends. Take any game on Unity. At first it works fast and well. Then it eats up all the memory and constantly starts “stop the world”. Writing in C # is easy and enjoyable, but writing good code is much more complicated than in C ++. Because it is a constant struggle with the garbage collector, which is under the hood.</p>

<p>I have an idea.  Just make auto bind AScript and lua.  Then wrap all existing function calls for backward compatibility.  Update rendering stuff.    Then make this version 2…    Then everyone will be happy.   Who is the expert of auto binding?</p>

<p>Some thoughts, I’m not even going to discussion of features but just the development speed and community structure.</p>
<p>Rbfx is doing great work. It’s basically leadership by coding, and having a minimal community that isn’t a burden. That is something to cherish. Trying to bring things back to Urho, and dealing with Urho community when you have minimal resources, is inevitably inertia.</p>
<p>Now my question is more to Urho community, in which ways would it have to change, and which requirements would you have to relax so that someone of you would want to step up as a lead and set the direction of the Urho codebase as going forward? It may be an impossible question, in which case it’s probably best that both forks work on their own.</p>

You see, at my current day job all project managers and architects were coders before they were promoted into new position, and they still code (albeit less) in their new positions because otherwise they will lose a touch.</p>
<p>In open source this is especially important because a person with a vision have to implement all or significant part of this vision.</p>
<p>I have seen talks about community components for years, and you have confirmed in this thread that this is part of your vision, but I don’t see it done, even after all these years.</p>

<p>CEOs do not have to be programmers, yet they can lead a software company. Indeed I have more experience using Urho to create games and software (including editors) than workin on the engine itself. In part because I feel I am simply not ready for the latter task in many cases. Also some of my engine contributions did not make it into the statistics due to the merging process.<br/>
Productivity can also come from cooperation, agreeing on near and long term goals helps remedy expectations of one’s efforts being futile. Also we must not ignore things like <span class="mention">@dertom</span>’s work; the engine code does not have to change for Urho to become more powerful.

Can you please elaborate how it works?</p>
<p>Lead developer can enforce their vision and shape the project into what they want.</p>

<p>In an open source project developers are a part of the community. Ideally a project leader leads both development <em>and</em> community, but this is merely the natural state in every beginning and a rare luxury after that.</p>

<p>Btw…the 2 times I made contributions here I forgot to do Lua or AS bindings and my PRs were getting stuck for a long time waiting for a merge. I’m not using Urho3D for anything shiny, its not even a game, so AS/Lua has no value for me…although its always nice to run my app with “–editor” flag and it turns on as Editor alongside all my code. The best thing about the engine for me is it (almost) run out of the box on every platform I need (35$ android box or RPI). If you can have an option to keep it that way, maybe a set of flags turning off mono/C# scripting, disable fancy PBR stuff and heavy (for low-end devices) rendering, I don’t see why not experiment with new stuff.</p>

<p>You are just trying to twist the words so they fit your position.<br/>
“He is not a developer” means he is not participating in active development. Bet the very next words are “maintainer”, and maintenance is something that software developers do.<br/>

<p>I’m just a recent new member of this community so don’t have much weight in saying. But imo if EASTL or just std containers are to replace existing Urho containers, maybe marking the old ones as deprecated so old code or code from people using old containers can still work.<br/>
I think there are a lot of people out there having their own forks of Urho3d, maybe not ready to merge to main repo yet, and some of them might be using Urho3d containers. If the new containers completely replace the old ones, it would create problems for those ppl.<br/>
We don’t need to keep deprecated containers forever. Maybe plan to completely remove them in far future or in a totally new version (like Ogre next)</p>

<p>I’ve been lurking for quite a while but I had to register just to comment because this thread is fascinating. First, I have to ask - <span class="mention">@adhoc99</span>, what do you expect to get out of this thread? You’re only derailing the topic, twisting other people’s words, and putting forward either pointless arguments (I particularly love the Linus one tbh), or saying “why don’t you go away then”, as if that would solve <strong>anything</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, a bit more ontopic, I think it’s hard to argue that Urho3D has seen a steep decline in commits and contributors in general. Stagnation in the 3d engine space is normally pretty bad for adoption, so it seems reasonable to assume that it’ll be a vicious cycle and eventually kill it unless something changes. rbfx on the other hand does have the commits and contributors and the energy, but perhaps lacking a solid community platform (forum, etc). To me, it seems pretty reasonable that there would be some sort of a merge (if not complete, at least partial), and this thread seems to be constantly deviating from that point.</p>
<p><em>Re: leadership without development</em><br/>
I think it’s definitely not the best option. In open source, having a vision and only being able to put that vision forward by making others do it for you seems like a recipe for disaster, as people are <em>volunteering</em> after all. It’d also make it harder to have clear visibility on technical debt, pain points, feature complexity, take decisions on architectural design, etc. It’s probably possible, it’s just impractical - it makes everything harder than it should be, while also introducing additional overhead.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Lastly, I imagine everyone who voted [against] in the poll has a proposal of how the future for Urho should look like, including who will be carrying out those changes? I went to count and there have been barely 10 commits or so that are not toolchain commits in the last ~2 months. And they are mostly small fixes. That seems a lot like how a maintenance branch would look, so I personally don’t understand the strong pusback to calling it like Urho 2.0 and moving forward. I guess the dealbreaker here will indeed be whether a solid leadership behind Urho forms that can steer the ship one way or the other.</p>

<p>I admit that you are experienced user of Urho.<br/>
What will you do if you are asked to make changes <em>in</em> the engine?<br/>
Lasse was asked this all the time. By me too.</p>
<p>For example, I want gamma correction.<br/>
Can you add it? Or can you point out to me what should I do to add it myself?<br/>
Or I need networking in Web builds. What should I do to get it?</p>
<p>This is what kind of questions are asked to a person in charge of a project.<br/>

I know a lot of examples of people who were project developers and then became project managers.<br/>
I know such people personally, at my dayjob.</p>
<p>How about you answer <em>my</em> question, and not the question you imagined for yourself?<br/>
There is specific scenario. A person who is <em>not</em> a project developer want to become project manager.<br/>
Do you know <em>any</em> example of such thing happening in open-source libraries/projects before? Without money involved, mind you. For money you can buy everything.</p>
<p>And if you cannot see the difference between “project developer” -&gt; “project manager” and “NOT project developer” -&gt; “project manager”, I don’t think I can make you see it.</p>

<p>Doesn’t Urho3D already have gamma correction but most shaders don’t use it?<br/>
PostProcess.glsl contains functions for applying and inversing gamma and PBR albedo textures are sampled with srgb gamma applied if I understand correctly but the engine is not inversing the final output by default. Sorry for being off topic.</p>

</aside>
<p>It means “doen’t support”.<br/>
If I cannot open samples and enable gamma correction without <em>rewriting shaders</em>, it’s not supported.</p>
