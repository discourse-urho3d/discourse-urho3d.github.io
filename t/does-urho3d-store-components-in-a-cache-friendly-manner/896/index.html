<p>Title says it all.  I have a simple question.</p>
<p>Does Urho3D store components in a cache friendly manner?  For example, the latest version of <a data-bbcode="true" href="https://github.com/alecthomas/entityx" rel="nofollow noopener">this project</a> stores components in a cache friendly way.</p>

<p>No. Components are allocated with new from the heap when created.</p>
<p>However, there aren’t actually any places in the code where it would need to iterate all components of a given type in order. For example Urho’s rigidbody component just contains a pointer to the Bullet rigidbody object, and Bullet does all the heavy lifting of the physics simulation within its own data structures. Culling when rendering a view is another; we don’t iterate all drawables, but rather those that are visible in the frustum.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I profiled Ogre 2.1 which goes to quite significant pains to allocate the scene objects in a cache and SIMD friendly way. I did the 250 x 250 individual object test (20_HugeObjectCount), which on both Ogre 2.1 and Urho, results in the renderer first frustum culling all the objects, then forming instanced rendering batches of them. Urho was 2x faster <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:"/></p>

<p><img alt=":astonished:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/astonished.png?v=5" title=":astonished:"/>  That’s crazy!  Wow!  I never would have guessed that the performance gap would be so great!</p>
<p>Just a quick question.  Will the rendering refactor update increase the speed even more?  Also will the rendering speed be improved for older versions of DirectX and OpenGL?  I use OpenGL 2.1. (yes my comp is pretty old  <img alt=":confused:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:"/> )</p>

<p>I heard that last week. I twirled my mustache and laughed maniacally for you.</p>

<p>You can expect some CPU / memory related improvements across all APIs in the render-refactor branch, though not that dramatic. Note that the 2x measurement was done using that branch.</p>
<p>D3D11 will have less expensive state changes compared to D3D9, but I’ve also seen cases where D3D9 is actually faster; guess the driver vendors have optimized some cases like your standard “for (all objects) SetUniform(); Draw();” quite extremely. The full benefit remains to be seen. I did some Turso3D vs Urho3D tests earlier, where D3D11 looked like a clear winner, but those are not completely fair as Urho has far more features and more complex shaders. After finishing D3D11 I will examine GL3 vs GL2, where the only difference will be the use of constant buffers. I’m not expecting that large gains from that.</p>

<p>That makes sense.   <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:"/>   I really appreciate the effort of the Urho3D development team.  I am just a beginning CS student so I won’t be of much help.   <img alt=":confused:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:"/></p>

<p>Now I have some more test data from a complex scene with many objects &amp; shadowcasting lights. On my dev machine D3D11 is 1.35x the speed of D3D9, which I find quite nice considering that the D3D11 code is still rather early yet.</p>
